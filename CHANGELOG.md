# 9.2.2018.2
Added Silent Mode toggle. Allows silently blocking players, entire realms, or everything. (Prevents whisper auto replies.)
Fixed edge case where the dialog box for declining players could persist and force you to whisper someone.
Added close button to above mentioned dialog box. (Note: This wont stop filtering them and the dialog box will return.)

# 9.2.2018
Fixed bad function call when unblocking target.
Fixed sometimes having no realm when blocking a player out of render range. (untested with different than own realm.)
