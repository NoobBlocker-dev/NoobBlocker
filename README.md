# NoobBlocker
Noob Blocker allows you to filter players or entire realms from your LFG party and from whispering you.

This addon will automatically send filtered players a whisper with a customizable message, and reply to any whispers from blocked players / realms automatically with the same message.

Some realms are undesirable to play with due to ping or language barriers. This lets you quickly filter those players without having to monitor the lfg list.

By default oceanic and latin american realms are blocked.
